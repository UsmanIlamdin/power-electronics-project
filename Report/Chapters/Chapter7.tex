In this paper, a three-phase 9-level cascaded multilevel
inverter with output voltage and frequency control has been
presented, achieving output signals with high quality and very
low THD. The phase shift and disposition orders of modulating signals are
another important point of design to reduce THD of line
current and voltages.The DC level of H-bridges has been intended to construct
output levels and dual DC supplies at Vdc:3Vdc ratio have
been constituted 9-level output voltage. The proposed model
has been tested and compared to its precedent conventional
models for THD rates and switching bandwidth. The
measurement results have presented perfect outcomes on
THD analysis. It is also seen that the switching frequency is directly effective
on THD.
