In this project we have developed the three phase rectifier and three phase inverter. We could have used the batteries or simple rectifier which can output the constant dc voltage but the main purpose of three phase rectifier is to have variable dc voltage.  The three phase rectifier simulated above is a controlled rectifier whose firing is such that the output voltage is 400VDC.The output can be varied by changing the gate pulses .The rectifier design should be such to remove the low order harmonics and improve the power factor. The inverter designed such that it can output the three phase output voltage of any fundamental frequency. The harmonics of non-triplets can distort the output voltage but in case of inductive load the higher order harmonics can be suppressed. The harmonics can incur the iron loses and copper loses. So the above project is useful in applications where the load require variable voltage and variable frequency(VVVF). The future work includes in increasing the efficiency of overall circuit and to cancel out the certain harmonics which can incur losses.
